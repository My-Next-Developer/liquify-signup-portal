- **Update user information** including application status and pushback reasons

#### Document Management
- **View all documents** with details:
  - Document ID and associated user
  - Document type (PASSPORT, PROOF_OF_ADDRESS, ID_CARD, LICENSE)
  - Upload timestamp
  - Deletion status
- **Search documents** by username
- **Filter documents** by document type and deletion status
- **View document files** directly in the admin interface
- **Soft delete management** - track deleted documents

### Setting Up Admin Access

1. **Create a superuser account:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts to set up:**
   - Username
   - Email address
   - Password

3. **Access the admin interface:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
   - Login with your superuser credentials

## Development Assumptions

### Design Decisions & Deviations

During the development of this portal, several assumptions were made that slightly deviate from the original technical document:

#### User Registration Simplification
- **Simplified Signup Process**: The user registration has been kept intentionally simple with just three essential fields:
  - Username
  - Email address
  - Password
- **Rationale**: This approach reduces friction during the initial signup process and allows users to get started quickly. Additional information can be collected later if needed.

#### Document Upload Workflow
- **Post-Registration Upload**: Users are required to sign up first before they can upload any documents
- **Sequential Process**: The workflow follows a logical sequence: Register â†’ Login â†’ Upload Documents
- **Rationale**: This ensures proper user authentication and data association before document uploads

#### Multiple Document Support
- **Flexible Upload System**: The portal allows users to upload multiple documents of different types
- **Rationale**: Real-world applications often require multiple supporting documents, and this flexibility accommodates various compliance requirements

#### Enhanced User Experience
- **Immediate Access**: Users can start uploading documents immediately after registration
- **Document Management**: Users can view, manage, and delete their uploaded documents
- **Status Tracking**: Clear application status visibility with pushback reason support

### Technical Implications

These assumptions have influenced the following technical decisions:

- **Database Design**: CustomUser model with application status tracking
- **API Structure**: Separate endpoints for user management and document operations
- **Frontend Flow**: Clear separation between authentication and document management
- **Admin Interface**: Comprehensive admin panel for managing both users and documents

## Document Quality Enhancement

### Problem Statement
One of the key challenges in document management systems is dealing with poor quality uploads such as:
- Badly cropped images
- Blurry or out-of-focus documents
- Poor lighting conditions
- Incomplete document captures

### Solution Approach

#### Frontend UX Improvements

**Upload Guide Integration**
- **Brief Quality Guidelines**: Display helpful tips when users start uploading documents
- **Best Practices**: Guide users on proper document capture techniques
- **Visual Examples**: Show examples of good vs. poor quality uploads

**Pre-Submission Quality Check**
- **Quick Display Functionality**: Show users a preview of their uploaded documents
- **Quality Confirmation Alert**: Prompt users to confirm document quality before submission
- **Re-upload Option**: Allow users to replace documents if quality is unsatisfactory
- **"Check Quality" Button**: Provide real-time quality feedback when users upload documents

#### Backend Quality Validation

**Image Sharpness Detection**
- **OpenCV Integration**: Implement sharpness checking using OpenCV
- **Blur Detection**: Analyze image clarity and focus quality
- **Quality Scoring**: Assign quality scores to uploaded documents

**OCR Functionality**
- **Text Extraction**: Extract and validate text content from documents
- **Content Verification**: Ensure documents contain expected information
- **Format Validation**: Check document structure and completeness

### Technical Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Basic Quality Checks**
```python
# Example implementation structure
- Image sharpness analysis using OpenCV
- Basic OCR using Tesseract
- Quality scoring algorithm
- Document format validation
```

**Phase 2: Advanced Features**
- Machine learning-based quality assessment
- AI-powered document classification
- Automated quality improvement suggestions

### Cost-Effective Approach

**Why This Solution?**
- **Cost-Effective**: Uses open-source tools (OpenCV, Tesseract) instead of expensive APIs
- **Time-Efficient**: Immediate implementation without ML model training
- **Scalable**: Can be enhanced with AI/ML solutions in future phases
- **Reliable**: Proven technologies with extensive community support

**Future Enhancements**
- Integration with OpenAI APIs for advanced document analysis
- Custom ML models for specific document types
- Real-time quality feedback during upload
- Automated document enhancement suggestions
- "Check Quality" Button Implementation - Real-time quality assessment after backend validation is stable
